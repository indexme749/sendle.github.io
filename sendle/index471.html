<h2>Where do i find my package tracking number?</h2>
<p class="s3s3">Your package tracking number can be found in confirmation or notification emails you’ve received.
 The package tracking number is also shared with your Sendler so they can keep track of the shipment progress via the Sendle tracking tool.
 Likewise, you’ll both be notified when the package completes its journey.
</p>
<p class="s3s4">Tip: You can find your package tracking reference in the email subject line for easy access! </p>

<div class="section4">
<h2 class="s4s1">Trouble finding your package?</h2>
<p class="s4s2">All shipments are monitored by Sendle’s package tracking tool. In the rare case the package tracker marks your shipment ‘delivered’,
 but you can’t seem to find it, here are the following possible scenarios:</p>
<div class="s4s3">My package is marked 'delivered' with a signature.</div>
<p class="s4s2">It was signed for by a colleague, family member, friend, or neighbor (the receiver may need to ask around).</p>
<p class="s4s2">It has been transferred to a third-party agent to complete delivery and it is still in transit. This is typical for more rural deliveries and is
 nothing to worry about—it’ll arrive soon! </p>
<p class="s4s2">Accidentally scanned as delivered when it was being scanned as in transit. We recommend waiting a day to see if it
receives an additional tracking scan. </p>
<div class="s4s3">My package is marked 'delivered' without a signature.</div>
<p class="s4s2">Since all packages with Sendle have 'Authority To Leave', the driver can leave the packages in a safe place on the property. </p>
<p class="s4s2">It was accidentally scanned as delivered when it was meant to be scanned as in-transit. We recommend waiting a day to
 see if it receives an additional tracking scan. </p>
